# icm20689 

A rust embedded-hal driver for the 
TDK InvenSense 
[ICM-20689](https://invensense.tdk.com/download-pdf/icm-20689-datasheet/)
6DOF accelerometer and gyroscope.

The ICM-20689 is a 6-axis motion tracking device 
that combines a 3-axis gyroscope, 3-axis accelerometer, 
and a motion processor.
